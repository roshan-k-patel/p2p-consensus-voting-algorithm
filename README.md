# consensus-voting-algorithm

Execute UDPServerListener before starting vote.
Compile Coordinator and Participants before running scripts / running in terminal with arguments

## Overview
*The purpose of this assignment is to implement a consensus protocol that tolerates participant
failures. The protocol involves two types of processes: a coordinator, whose role is to initiate a run of
the consensus algorithm and collect the outcome of the vote; and a participant, which contributes a
vote and communicates with the other participants to agree on an outcome. Your application should
consist of 1 coordinator process and N participant processes, out of which any number of participants
may fail during the run of the consensus algorithm. The actual consensus algorithm is run among the
participant processes, with the coordinator only collecting outcomes from the participants. The
behaviour of the two types of processes is described below. Furthermore, your application should
include a logger server where the other processes send log messages over the UDP protocol*
